# Welcome to Tooty CMS

Thanks for giving Tooty a shot.

I built this CMS because I wanted a publishing system that stays clear under pressure: fast for editors, predictable for engineers, and practical for real teams.

## What You Have Right Now

- Domain-based content types with one consistent workflow.
- Theme and plugin contracts that keep core behavior stable.
- Site-scoped roles and capability-based access.
- Setup and schema lifecycle controls designed for safe upgrades.

## What The Tooty Community Can Be

- Builders sharing production-tested themes and plugins.
- Teams improving contracts, not patching around them.
- Contributors helping shape a CMS that values clarity over clutter.

## Start Here

1. Publish your first real post.
2. Set up your key pages and menu structure.
3. Pick a theme and make it yours.
4. Share what you build and what could be better.

Thanks again for using Tooty.
