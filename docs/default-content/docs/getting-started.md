# Getting Started: The First Lantern

Tooty CMS starts simple: one site, one editor, one publish path.

## Step 1: Open Your Main Site

- Go to the dashboard.
- Confirm your primary site settings.
- Check that your public domain resolves.

## Step 2: Create Your First Post

- Open the editor.
- Add a clear title and short summary.
- Publish and verify the page URL.

## Step 3: Confirm Documentation Routes

- Open /documentation
- Open /c/documentation

If both pages render, your docs lane is alive.
