# Writing and Publishing

A clean post is easier to maintain than a clever one.

## Write in Layers

- Begin with a headline and one-sentence promise.
- Use short sections with direct subheadings.
- End with one action the reader can take.

## Use Terms with Intent

- Categories group broad subjects.
- Tags describe smaller traits.
- Keep naming stable so archives stay useful.

## Publish Checklist

- Title is specific.
- Description is readable in search snippets.
- Slug is short and human.
- Hero image is present (or default art is active).
