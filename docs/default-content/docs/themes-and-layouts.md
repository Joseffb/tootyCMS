# Themes and Layouts

Your theme is the stage. Content is the story.

## Layout Rule of Thumb

- Use `post` for articles and updates.
- Use `page` for docs, policy, and evergreen guidance.

## Theme Workflow

- Start with semantic HTML and clear spacing.
- Keep typography calm and legible.
- Add decorative styling after readability is solved.

## Menu Guidance

- Keep docs links visible in the header.
- Link your archive and one or two key pages.
- Avoid deep nested navigation for early versions.
