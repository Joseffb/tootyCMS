# Data Domains and Taxonomy

When one content type is not enough, Data Domains open more lanes.

## Data Domains

Use Data Domains when you need separate structures for different content families.

Examples:
- Tutorials
- Changelogs
- Product notes

## Taxonomy

- Categories: broad shelves.
- Tags: fine labels.

For docs, keep one stable category slug (`documentation`) so `/c/documentation` remains dependable.

## Stability Practice

- Pick slugs once.
- Avoid frequent rename churn.
- Favor predictable URLs over clever naming.
