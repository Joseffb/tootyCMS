# Documentation: The Scribe's Index

Welcome, builder. This is your map through Tooty CMS.

If you are new, begin with **Getting Started**. If you already have a live site, jump to **Writing and Publishing**.

## The Main Paths

- Docs Archive: /c/documentation
- Docs Home: /documentation
- Getting Started: /docs-getting-started
- Writing and Publishing: /docs-writing-and-publishing
- Themes and Layouts: /docs-themes-and-layouts
- Data Domains and Taxonomy: /docs-data-domains-and-taxonomy

## Quick Quest

- Create or open a site.
- Publish one post.
- Add a category and confirm the archive route.
- Tune your theme and menu.

When you return, this index will still be here like a lantern at the road split.
