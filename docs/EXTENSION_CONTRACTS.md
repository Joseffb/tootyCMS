# Extension Contracts

Tooty supports both plugins and themes with explicit governance to avoid unmanaged entropy.

## Core Authority (MUST)

Core is the only authority for:

- Routing, auth, and security
- Database writes and schema changes
- Render pipeline and extension loading
- Side effects (must flow through Core APIs)

## Plugin Contract

Typed contract: `PluginContract` (`lib/extension-contracts.ts`)

Plugins may:

- Register hooks and admin extensions through Core kernel APIs
- Register content-type and server behavior only through Core contract surfaces
- Read/write scoped settings through the Plugin Extension API
- Register content types and server handlers through Plugin Extension API methods exposed by Core

Plugins may not:

- Bypass auth checks
- Write raw DB tables directly as an extension contract
- Mutate routing/auth/schema outside Core

## Theme Contract

Typed contract: `ThemeContract` (`lib/extension-contracts.ts`)

Themes may:

- Provide layouts, components, styles, and assets
- Use lightweight template conditionals for presentation decisions

Themes may not:

- Execute server-side side effects
- Perform DB writes
- Alter auth, routing, or schema

Runtime guardrails:

- `createThemeExtensionApi()` throws when side-effect methods are called (`setSetting`, `setPluginSetting`).
- Plugin runtime enforces declared capability flags and throws `[plugin-guard]` on unauthorized operations.

## Loader Validation

Manifest files are validated before activation:

- Plugins: `plugins/*/plugin.json` via `validatePluginContract()`
- Themes: `themes/*/theme.json` via `validateThemeContract()`

Invalid manifests are ignored at discovery time.

## Directory Contract

- Themes: `themes/<theme-id>/...`
- Plugins: `plugins/<plugin-id>/...`

Core discovers extensions only from these roots.
